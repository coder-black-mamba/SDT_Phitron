ðŸ§  Day-by-Day Advanced OOP Mastery Plan
## âœ… Day 1: Deep Dive into Classes & Objects
Topics: __init__, class vs instance attributes, __str__, __repr__

Task: Create a Book class with attributes like title, author, and price. Add methods to display and update details.

Resource: Real Python - Classes and Objects

## âœ… Day 2: Inheritance + Composition
Topics: Single, Multi-level, and Multiple Inheritance, Composition

Task: Build a Vehicle, Car, Truck hierarchy; then refactor to use Composition for Engine or Fuel classes.

Resource: Python OOP Tutorial (Corey Schafer)

## âœ… Day 3: Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
Topics: _protected, __private, name mangling, getter/setter, @property

Task: Simulate a Bank Account system with balance protection and transaction logs.

Resource: Python Encapsulation - Programiz

## âœ… Day 4: Polymorphism + Method Overriding
Topics: Overriding methods, Duck Typing

Task: Create an Animal class with multiple subclasses like Dog, Cat, using polymorphism to call make_sound().

Resource: GeeksforGeeks - Polymorphism

## Day 5: Abstract Base Classes & Interfaces
Topics: abc module, abstract methods

Task: Design a Shape class with abstract methods area() and perimeter().

Resource: Real Python - Abstract Base Classes

## Day 6: Static Methods, Class Methods, Operator Overloading
Topics: @staticmethod, @classmethod, __add__, __lt__, etc.

Task: Create a Point class and overload math operators; add class-wide statistics.

Resource: Real Python - Special Methods

## Day 7: Decorators and Property Decorators
Topics: Inner functions, closures, decorators, @property, @<property>.setter

Task: Write a decorator to log function calls and execution time.

Resource: Python Decorators - Real Python

## Day 8: Class Composition vs Inheritance
Topics: When to use Composition over Inheritance

Task: Refactor an inheritance-heavy class into a composition-based design (Student, Course, GradeBook)

Resource: Composition vs Inheritance - Python OOP Best Practices

## Day 9: Design Patterns in OOP
Topics: Singleton, Factory, Builder

Task: Implement:

Singleton: Logger class

Factory: Shape Factory

Builder: HTML tag builder

Resource: Refactoring.Guru Python Patterns

## Day 10: UML + Real-World Project
Topics: UML class diagrams, docstrings, best practices

Task: Design a School Management System with multiple interacting classes. Document using docstrings and UML diagram.

Tool: draw.io

Bonus: Use pyreverse or PlantUML to auto-generate UML

âœ… Tips for Mastery
Write code daily.

Read open-source project code (e.g., Django models).

Build mini-projects like:

Inventory System

Task Manager

Role-Based Access Control App
