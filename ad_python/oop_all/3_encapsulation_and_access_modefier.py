Protected members are identified with a single underscore (_). They are meant to be accessed only within the class or its subclasses.

"""
Private members
Private members are identified with
 a double underscore (__) and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. 
 Python uses name mangling to make private members inaccessible by renaming them internally.

Note: Pythonâ€™s private and protected members can be accessed outside the class through python name mangling.
